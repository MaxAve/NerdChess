# NerdChess Engine
NerdChess is a WIP (work in progress) chess engine created by myself for educational purposes. According to plan, this engine should apply
basic algorithms to create a sensible chess game, such as a MiniMax algorithm, basic position evaluation, etc. Please note: this project
is currently a work-in-progress, and many features are still missing.
## Roadmap
Here is what I plan on adding and what I am currently attempting to implement:
1. Bitboard implementation - **DONE**
2. Moving/capturing pieces - *WIP*
3. Position evaluation
4. MiniMax algorithm
5. Necessary optimizations (optional)
6. Create a chess.com account and test to see how much ELO the engine can get (it's not cheating if I say that the account belongs to the engine)
7. Challenge my classmates for a game with the engine and let NerdChess humiliate them.
## Recent changes
