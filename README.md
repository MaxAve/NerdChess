# NerdChess Engine
NerdChess is a WIP (work in progress) chess engine created by myself for educational purposes. According to plan, this engine should apply
basic algorithms to create a sensible chess game, such as a MiniMax algorithm, basic position evaluation, etc. Please note: this project
is currently a work-in-progress, and many features are still missing.
## Roadmap
Here is what I plan on adding and what I am currently attempting to implement:
1. Bitboard implementation - **DONE**
2. Moving/capturing pieces - *ALMOST DONE*
3. Position evaluation - *ALMOST DONE*
4. Minimax algorithm - *WIP*
5. Add opening book
6. Necessary optimizations (optional)
7. Add support for importing/exporting PGN and FEN (optional)
8. Add interactive GUI
